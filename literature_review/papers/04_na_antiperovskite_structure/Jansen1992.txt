Measurement of the electrical conductivity of Na3O (NO2) and Na3O (CN) show that both compounds show a sudden increase in sodium ion conductivity at temperatures between 200 ° and 250 ° C. These effects are not based on melting processes, as the phase diagrams of the corresponding pseudo-binary systems NaNO2 / Na2O and NaCN / Na2O show, but are due to rotational diffusion of the complex anions or partial melting of the partial cation structure.
