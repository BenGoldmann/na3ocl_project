Through a reaction between the solid constituents sodium oxide and sodium peroxide with sodium nitrite, substances are obtained that are known as sodium orthonitrite or orthonitrate. They do not behave as salts in some typical reaction systems, but rather fully display the properties of their constituents. It is not possible to produce a corresponding ortho-nitric acid or ortho-nitric acid.
