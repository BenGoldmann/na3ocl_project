Sodium oxide Na2O combines with many salts of simple oxygen acids to form ortho salts, which cannot be represented with NaOH or Na2CO3. So z. B. when heating sodium nitrite with, sodium oxide deep yellow sodium orthonitrite Na3NO3, from sodium nitrate and sodium oxide white sodium orthonitrate Na3NO4 is formed. Most metal oxides also react easily with sodium oxide to form salts; Silver oxide combines z. B. with sodium oxide to form the light green colored sodium orthoargentite Na3AgO2.
