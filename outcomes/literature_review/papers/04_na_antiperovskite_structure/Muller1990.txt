According to single-crystal structure investigations, the crystal structure of Na3O (CN) = (CN) ONa3 is derived from the antiperovskite type (a = 454.3 (1) pm, Pm3m); the cyanide anion is disordered. Above 230 ° C, Na3O (CN) is a fast sodium ion conductor. The high mobility of sodium ions results on the one hand from the rotational diffusion of the CN − anion (revolving door effect) and on the other hand from the partial melting of the cation structure.
